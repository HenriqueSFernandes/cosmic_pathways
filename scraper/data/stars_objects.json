The bright central star is hidden behind a mask in the center of the image to enable the detection of the exoplanet, which is 1 million times fainter than 51 Eridani. The exoplanet is on the outskirts of the planetary system 11 billion miles from its star. Its distance is equivalent to a location between the orbits of Neptune and Saturn in our solar system. The 51 Eridani system is 96 light-years from Earth.</p>\n<p>Webb will probe the planet’s atmosphere at infrared wavelengths astronomers have rarely used to image distant worlds. Webb will also hunt for other distant worlds — possibly down to Saturn-size — on the outskirts of planetary systems that cannot be detected with ground-based telescopes.</p>",

As the stars orbit each other and dust is produced, a distinctive pinwheel pattern is formed, as shown in this image from the European Southern Observatory. Warm dust like this glows in the mid-infrared wavelengths of light detectable by NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope. Confirming the origin of dust will help account for the mysterious over-abundance of it found in galaxies, which is crucial to the later development of stars, planets, and life as we know it.</p>",

(The light from HR 4796A and its binary companion, HR 4796B, have been blocked to reveal the much dimmer dust structure.) A bright, narrow inner ring of dust encircling the star may have been corralled by the gravitational pull of an unseen giant planet.</p>",
