# Cosmic Pathways

Cosmic Pathways is a 3D web application that models the universe in an immersive and visually engaging way, merging realistic astronomical data with an artistic touch. This project was developed as part of the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024 and was awarded the winning project in Lisbon.

Here is a 30-second demo video that was presented in the competition (with music):

### Project Concept
The main goal of Cosmic Pathways is to provide an interactive platform that integrates stunning imagery from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) with an immersive user experience. The project goes a step further by associating these visuals with original music and in the future automatically generated soundscapes. This approach creates a deeper connection between the visuals and the emotions they evoke.

### Features
- **3D Universe Representation:** Explore a visually accurate model of the universe, navigating through galaxies, stars, and nebulae in a browser-based environment.
- **Integration with JWST Imagery:** Featuring some of the most iconic images captured by the James Webb Space Telescope.
- **Original Music:** All music in the application is uniquely composed for this project, adding an emotional layer to the experience.
  - *Original music by Filipe Gaio.*

### Development
This project was developed by four students in under 48 hours as part of the hackathon. It showcases the power of teamwork, creativity, and passion for both technology and music.
